```

## Report Contents

The generated report includes:

```bash
python -m worker_plan_internal.report.report_generator /home/user/my_project/worker_plan_internal_dir
```

This will:
1. Generate a report named `report.html` in the specified directory
2. Automatically open the report in your default web browser

## Troubleshooting

1. **Missing Files**
   - The script will warn you about any missing files
   - The report will still generate with available data

2. **Browser doesn't open**
   - The report is still generated
   - Manually open the HTML file from the output directory

3. **Invalid JSON**
   - Check if the JSON files are properly formatted
   - The script will skip invalid files and continue with valid ones
